              Therapy is about where you are and where you want to go. It is
              about acceptance of your values and the goals that you seek.
              Therapy doesn't have to be a long painful journey. Resolving
              conflicts, getting over issues, or addressing unwanted feelings
              should be a positive quest. I believe in short term therapy which
              has been successful with my Adult and Adolescent clients who
              experience depression, anxiety, trauma and other symptoms. Life
              Coaching-Therapy can help uncover the patterns of feelings,
              thoughts or patterns of behavior that have interfered with our
              goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              I graduated with a Masters in Psychology and have 4 years post
              masters training in marriage and family therapy and have been
              trained in EMDR. My approach is guided by you and your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a person first and therapist second. Working on problems is
              serious but I feel having a little humor and focusing on strengths
              can make the process more normal. I have the wisdom and experience
              with a youthful spirit which allows me to relate to all ages. If I
              can't help you I know someone who can. I am connected to a group
              of talented therapists.

              If you're on this page, I assume that you're looking for
              something! What are you looking for?

            <p>
              How to make changes, deal with feelings of abandonment, betrayal
              or trauma? Feelings of "I'm not good enough?" Trauma and PTSD can
              result from chronic physical and emotional assaults on your person
              - daily events of forced control, not being trusted, name-calling
              or insinuations by tone of voice! The trauma can come from
              childhood or yesterday. What can you change? Are there options?
            </p>
            <p>
              Our first session will be learning about you. What do you want
              from therapy and how can I help you? We'll discuss all that and
              talk about options and changes. And we'll try to heal the broken
              places!
            </p>
            <p>
              My specialty is healing the broken places! The second is helping
              you develop the strength and courage to be all that you want to

            </p>
            <p>
              Therapy is not about comparing yourself to others! You most likely
              observed long ago that life hands us all different baskets - many
              heavier than others but all different! Therapy is about you - not
              anyone else! It is about the things that come into your life. Life
              is a Journey - not a Destination! I would be honored to share a
              part of your Journey!
            </p>
