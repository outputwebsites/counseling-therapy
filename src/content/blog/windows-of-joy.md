Our days are filled with so many things; if someone were to ask us how our day is going, we’d probably tell them about all the frustrating things that have happened – the half hour on the phone going through 10
different phone menus only to be told we need to call a different number or the school calling to tell us something we didn’t want to hear!  It just never ends!

 

But, have you ever looked for a Window of Joy?  Most of these windows are small and you often
have to use your imagination.  Here are a few examples.  

 

There’s an old, bent palm tree sticking out of the water in the retention pond near where I live. 
The trunk of the tree comes out of the water at an angle.  When I go for a walk and pass by, the turtles
that are lined up on the trunk of the tree must hear me coming because they all slide off into the water, plop, plop, plop!  Last Sunday, there were 5 turtles all lined up behind each other.  How peaceful and content were those turtles?

 

Or, there was the red, male cardinal bird who used to come and sit on the arm of the truck’s rear-view mirror.  He was jealous of the beautiful red bird in the mirror and spent a considerable amount of time each morning pecking at his rival.  Silly bird!  After scolding the bird in the mirror properly, he flew away – and so did the other bird!

 

I remember the early morning, many years ago, when I went walking, trying to find some hope in my dark days.  The sun was behind me and in front of me, a line of ants were crossing the sidewalk — left to right.  The sun was still so low above the horizon that it shone under the ants, making the shadows of their legs looked 
l-o-n-g on the sidewalk – like thin, rectangular bodies atop busy, toothpick legs.  It occurred to me that I was the only one in the world witnessing that small phenomena – that small picture show!  It was a moment of awe.  The ants gave me hope!

 

Look around!  What do you see?  Look closely at the flower on the weed at your feet.  Is it not as
intricate and as carefully formed as the flowers in the floral section of the supermarket?    What about the birds that are raising their babies atop the light pole at that busy intersection?  How do they do that?  



Place your hand on your chest.  Feel your lungs fill and empty.  How many years have they been doing
that?  Isn’t that amazing?
