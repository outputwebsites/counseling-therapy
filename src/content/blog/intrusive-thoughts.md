Can you trust your brain?  Here are some things your brain may tell you from time to time:  “You can’t do anything right!”  “You’ll never be as good an Zi!”  “Your dad was right when he was drunk and said…”!”   “You’re setting yourself up to make a real fool of yourself!”   “You’re just not good enough!”  Your brain has your best interests at heart and you should listen to it, right?”

\
Let’s decide what a habit is!

\
After earning a Master’s Degree in Social Work in 2006, I began working in Community Mental Health with children and their parents.  From this perspective, it was clear that though there are patterns of behavior connected to environments and inherited characteristics, behavioral patterns  are complicated  and are a combination of genetics and environment.  Genetics and environment merge and blend; there is no line to mark where one ends and the other begins.

\
The only true fact is this: none of us are islands unto ourselves.  We need human connection, we need contact, we need each other.  Without each other, we are often feel lost, battling the world by ourselves!

\
We want things to change, we want our relationships and connections to be better, and we wait for a miracle from outside ourselves to give us the life that we long for, but it doesn’t happen.   We cannot wait for an outside force to save us or to be perfect or to be better than we are, right now, so people will like us or so that we can have satisfying relationships.  We have to reach out, to connect with others, to bond with other human beings.  Our pain, our loneliness, our aching wounds will not be healed if we wait for external forces to save us before deciding it is safe to reach out.  We have to be the agents of change in our lives!  We have to reach out and build the relationships we want!  Healing of relationships, of whatever it is that we long for, works in reverse to waiting for the initial step to come from outside us!  We have to reach out first, we have to believe that we are worthy of connection and of healing to take place.

\
You are worthy of connection!  You are worthy of respect and healing and love.  I believe that Life  is a Journey and not a destination.  You are not who those negative voices say you are!

\
Whether you are somewhere in the middle of life, nearer the end or just beginning, I would like to work with you.
How can I help you?
