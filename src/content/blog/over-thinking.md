Over thinking can be distressing and distracting.  You are not alone with this and the number of people afflicted with this seems to be on the rise.  To sort out the cause can be frustrating.  Be careful not to jump on a trend to understand your cause.  If it is of recent onset it usually not due to ADHD.  Having obsessive thoughts that repeat can increase with stress and use of mood altering substances.  Anxiety from life changes and feeling stuck oft times circle in our heads.  One issue that is a cause for some is the overwhelming intake of negative social media feeding mistrust and insecurity. These can be helped but sorting out the center of your symptoms comes first.  Start with a little self care.  Take a brake from some of the media, treat your body well by exercising and avoiding mood altering substances.
