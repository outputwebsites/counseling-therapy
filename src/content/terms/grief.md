Grief usually refers to the intense sadness felt over the death of someone dear to us. However, it can also be over the loss of a friendship or divorce, the loss of a job or financial stability, the loss of a home or other things of value to us. Grief can manifest as sadness, anger, guilt, or confusion. Grieving is a natural process, but it can also lead to mental health concerns if itâ€™s prolonged or complicated.
