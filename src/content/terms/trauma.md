Trauma and PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) is a lasting emotional response to a distressing or overwhelming event that significantly impacts our sense of safety, self, and ability to regulate emotions. It is often the result of a life-threatening situation, violence (either physical or emotional), natural disaster or death of a loved one. Trauma can result in flashbacks, fear and difficulty maintaining relationships â€“ either personal or employment.
