bio: What do you want from therapy? How can I help you? We'll discuss all that
  and talk about options and changes and what your ideal life would look like.
  My goal is listening and helping you to heal the broken places! The second is
  helping you develop the strength and courage to be all that you want to be!
biography: >-
  Greetings! I’m a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) who enjoys meeting
  people of all ages. Every person is different; their life experiences are
  different and their needs and goals are different. What works for one person
  will not work for another. I use an eclectic approach that allows me to treat
  each individual according to their own unique needs and wants.


  Life is filled with ups and downs and our life experiences make us into who we are. If we’re trying to learn how to make better choices, it helps to look at decisions we’ve made in the past. How did those experiences, even the ones from childhood, affect us? Examining those things can make a big difference in how we move forward.


  Many times, it’s the intrusive thoughts – the ‘what ifs’ that darken our days. Whether it’s anxiety, depression, grief and loss, PTSD, or relationship problems, I want to encourage you that there is hope for a brighter path ahead.


  One, true fact is that none of us are islands unto ourselves. We need human connection, we need contact, we need each other. Without each other, we often feel lost, like we’re battling the world by ourselves! If your background is one of confusion and chaos, do not despair! Even if your world isn’t confused and chaotic, don’t put yourself down! You are worthy of connection! You are worthy of respect, healing, and happiness! Life is a journey, not a destination, and you are worthy of a good and fulfilling journey!


  Whether you are somewhere in the middle of life, nearer the end or closer to the beginning, I would like to work with you. How can I help you?
