bio: I am a person first and therapist second. Working on problems is serious
  but I feel having a little humor and focusing on strengths can make the
  process more normal. I have the wisdom and experience with a youthful spirit
  which allows me to relate to all ages. If I can't help you I know someone who
  can. I am connected to a group of talented therapists.
biography: Therapy is about where you are and where you want to go. It is about
  acceptance of your values and the goals that you seek. Therapy doesn't have to
  be a long painful journey. Resolving conflicts, getting over issues, or
  addressing unwanted feelings should be a positive quest. I believe in short
  term therapy which has been successful with my Adult and Adolescent clients
  who experience depression, anxiety, trauma and other symptoms. Life
  Coaching-Therapy can help uncover the patterns of feelings, thoughts or
  patterns of behavior that have interfered with our goals. I graduated with a
  Masters in Psychology and have 4 years post masters training in marriage and
  family therapy and have been trained in EMDR. My approach is guided by you and
  your needs. I am a person first and therapist second. Working on problems is
  serious but I feel having a little humor and focusing on strengths can make
  the process more normal. I have the wisdom and experience with a youthful
