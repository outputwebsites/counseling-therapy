biography: "As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, I take pride in providing
  accessible, quality comprehensive collaborative mental and behavioral health
  services to improve the quality of life of clients and families. I am
  dedicated to working with and supporting those in the community through their
  journey to positive mental health. I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker,
  Certified Clinical Trauma Professional, Registered Play Therapist, and EMDR
  trained. Life is sometimes messy and confusing. Experiences and painful
  memories weave through aspects of our lives and can be overwhelming and
  unbearable for anyone. Even when problems aren't so big and it would be
  helpful to talk to someone, I am available to listen, assist, and support your
  growth and well-being."
